# Jelly Forge â€” AI 3D Icon & App Icon Generator

Jelly Forge turns logos into stunning 3D jelly icons with glassmorphism effects. Download transparent PNGs ready for iOS, Android, and the web. Built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and [Convex](https://www.convex.dev/), with authentication by [Clerk](https://clerk.com/).

## Getting Started

First, you need to set up your environment variables. Create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project and add the following:

```
# Deployment used by `npx convex dev`
CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT=

NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=

CLERK_FRONTEND_API_URL=
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
