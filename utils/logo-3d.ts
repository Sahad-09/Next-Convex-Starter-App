Create jelly 3D icons that are translucent, soft, with inner glow effects and perfect studio lighting.

A 3D-rendered icon showcases the uploaded logo, placed at the center of a soft, jelly-like button with rounded corners. The icon appears raised, glowing subtly with a soft internal halo effect. The button base features a contrasting translucent color, while the logo adopts a brighter tone with a jelly-glass texture. The background is a smooth gradient of pastel or warm cream, with soft ambient lighting and diffused shadows enhancing the overall depth and clarity.`;
